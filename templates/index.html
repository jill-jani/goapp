      <p> Go was invented in 2007 at such a time when multicore CPU architectures were common everywhere, and no programming language simplified the development of multithreaded applications. The responsibility of managing different threads safely and efficiently was a huge responsibility on developers. Go is different from other languages; it is young yet so powerful.
      Being a compiled, statically typed language, itâ€™s much faster than interpreted options and also offers most of the performance benefits.
      </p>
      <p> Go as a language is more similar to C, however in addition to C features, Go offers memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-Style concurrency.
